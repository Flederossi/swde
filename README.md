# swde
A small script to set animated wallpapers using the windows api.

### Note: The script isn't that performant in higher resolutions and should only be used in test scenarios. When it didn't work try to turn the fps down.

## Usage
* 1.) ```Setup the directory 'C:\swde'```
* 2.) ```Put your frames in alphabetical order in it```
* 2.1) ```If you get to Z begin again like 'ZA, ZB, ...'```
* 3.) ```Run the script from anywhere```
#### Your animation should start as background.

## Example
* ```You can try the script with the preconfigured frames in the example folder.```

## Stop the script
* ```The script starts as a background process so you have to stop ist via task manager.```
